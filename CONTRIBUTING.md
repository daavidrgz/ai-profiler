# Contributing

## Pull Request Process

This will be the set of rules that we will follow when contributing to this project:

1. **Test your changes**: Unless what you are doing is _absolutely_ trivial, add unit tests. Good unit tests come in
   bundles, and should test for both the expected and unexpected cases.

2. **Discuss your architecture first**: If you are making changes that add new algorithms, new datasets, or
   reorganize an existing codebase, it is helpful to plan how best to achieve that. A GitHub issue is the place to have this
   conversation.

3. **Create meaninful commits**: Try to follow the basic principel of "one commit, one change". If you are making
   multiple changes, try to split them in a way that makes sense. Also use a predefined commit message format. Finally,
   if there are a lot of changes, consider squashing them into a single commit.

4. **Follow the style guide**: We use [autopep8](https://pypi.org/project/autopep8/) to format our code in the backend. You can
   install it with `pip install autopep8`. To format your code, run `autopep8 --ignore=E731 --max-line-length=120`. As for the
   frontend, we use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) with its default settings. You can install it with `npm install -g prettier`.
